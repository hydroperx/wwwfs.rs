# World Wide Web File System

This library provides easier bindings for the Web File System APIs.

> **Note:** This crate only works in the browser. This was heavily modified from the [opfs](https://github.com/anchpop/opfs) crate, which did support other platforms, but this fork decided to strip off that additional platform support.
